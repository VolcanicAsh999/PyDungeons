# PyDungeons
Minecraft Dungeons clone in Python.

It is currently being updated, I would suggest not enchanting your bow unless you like huge errors

This is my attempt at making a Minecraft Dungeons clone. I added as many
of the same weapons and items as I could that are in Minecraft Dungeons as
well, and added many of the same mobs.

However, the gameplay is quite different, being more of a game with simply fighting
than certain levels and a story like Minecraft Dungeons. The graphics are much different also.

Sorry for the essentially comment-less code, I may add more in the future.
